Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it: it's powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

I'm following the process from [Jonathan McGlone](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/).
